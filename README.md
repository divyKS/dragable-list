# Draggable & Rearranging List
Created a mini-project showcasing a list that can be rearranged by draggging and dropping the various elements of the list. In making this project I learnt the following things
- Difference and use of `clientX/Y`, `screenX/Y` and `pageX/Y` properties
- JavaScript `reduce()` function - a higher-order function that reduces an array to a single value. The callback function is executed for each element of the array, updating the accumulator with each iteration.
- `appendChild()` function's detail  - if the given child is a reference to an existing node in the document, it moves it from the old position to the new position â€” there is no requirement to remove the node from its previous parent node before appending it to the new node
- `getBoundingClientRect()` function - this function returns a `DOMRect` object providing information about the size of an element and its position relative to the viewport
- CSS object-fit properties: `cover` and `contain`
